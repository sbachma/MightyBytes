        <h2>History of Marvel</h2>
        <p>
          Pulp-magazine publisher Martin Goodman created the company later known
          as Marvel Comics under the name Timely Publications in 1939. Goodman,
          who had started with a Western pulp in 1933, was expanding into the
          emerging—and by then already highly popular—new medium of comic books.
          Launching his new line from his existing company's offices at 330 West
          42nd Street, New York City, he officially held the titles of editor,
          managing editor, and business manager, with Abraham Goodman (Martin's
          brother) officially listed as publisher.
        </p>

        <p>
          Goodman's business strategy involved having his various magazines and
          comic books published by a number of corporations all operating out of
          the same office and with the same staff. One of these shell companies
          through which Timely Comics was published was named Marvel Comics by
          at least Marvel Mystery Comics #55 (May 1944). As well, some comics'
          covers, such as All Surprise Comics #12 (Winter 1946–47), were labeled
          "A Marvel Magazine" many years before Goodman would formally adopt the
          name in 1961.

          The first modern comic books under the Marvel Comics brand were the
          science-fiction anthology Journey into Mystery #69 and the teen-humor
          title Patsy Walker #95 (both cover dated June 1961), which each
          displayed an "MC" box on its cover. Then, in the wake of DC Comics'
          success in reviving superheroes in the late 1950s and early 1960s,
          particularly with the Flash, Green Lantern, Batman, Superman, Wonder
          Woman, Green Arrow and other members of the team the Justice League of
          America, Marvel followed suit.

        <h2>Stan Lee</h2>
        <p>
          Stan Lee (born Stanley Martin Lieber /ˈliːbər/; December 28, 1922 –
          November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer, editor,
          publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run
          business called Timely Publications which would later become Marvel
          Comics. He was the primary creative leader for two decades, leading
          its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a
          multimedia corporation that dominated the comics and film industries.
        </p>
        <img src="Photos/StanLee.jpg" id="StanLee1" />
        <p>
          In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writers/artists
          Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created iconic characters, including
          superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man,
          the Wasp, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor
          Strange, the Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow. These and other
          characters' introductions in the 1960s pioneered a more naturalistic
          approach in superhero comics, and in the 1970s Lee challenged the
          restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to
          changes in its policies. In the 1980s he pursued the development of
          Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lee died on November 12, 2018, just one month before his 96th
          birthday, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, after being
          rushed there for a medical emergency earlier in the day. Lee had
          previously been hospitalized for pneumonia in February of that year.
          The immediate cause of death listed on his death certificate was
          cardiac arrest with respiratory failure and congestive heart failure
          as underlying causes. It also indicated that he suffered from
          aspiration pneumonia. His body was cremated and his ashes were given
          to his daughter.
